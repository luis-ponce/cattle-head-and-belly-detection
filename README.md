# cattle-head-and-belly-detection

In this repo we are using YOLOV5 to identify cattle belies and heads. The code in the notebook shows the calibration and a recalibration starting from the best weight set generated. 
The weights files are not shared in this repo. Yet they can be generated by running the notebook after installing yolov5 from the ultralirics repository. 
Labels for training were obtained by using label studio. The figure below is an example of segmentation labeling used in this project.
